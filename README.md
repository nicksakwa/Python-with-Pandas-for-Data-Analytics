In this Github repository I discuss data analytics with the Python Pandas library.
Pandas is core library used for reading, analyzing , cleaning and visualizing data from csv files, excel sheets, JSON data and SQL databases.
It is an important cornerstone for Data Science and Data Analytics.

For this repository you must first download python from the python.org official website.
Install pandas using pip install pandas on your remote terminal.
Run python apps in the terminal using python filename.py

I look at Pandas methods such as head method df.head()
tail method df.tail()
info method df.info()

Data cleaning methods such as
Drop duplicates method df.drop_duplicates()
SHow duplicates method df.duplicated()

Data Plotting Methods such as
Pandas .plot used for generating line grpahs
Scatter plot for genertating scatter graphs
histogram plot for generating histogram graphs
